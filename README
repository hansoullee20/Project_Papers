This repository contains final papers from my previous summer research internships, Research Experience for Undergraduates(REU) funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Descriptions for the summer programs are written below:

1. File Name: Focus, Guide., and Alignment system for DESI.pdf

  Advisor: Dr. Kevin Reil, SLAC National Laboratory
  Location: Stanford Linear Accelerator, Palo Alto, California
  
  I was a selected participant for Wayne State University's REU program (https://clas.wayne.edu/physics/research/reu).
  The project investigated the Mayall Telescope calibration before installing the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to create a 3D model
  of the universe. Astronomical objects were identified from Images taken by 60 CCD cameras in eight different galactic latitudes using UNIX based image recognition 
  program Source-Extractor(https://sextractor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction.html). The mined data proceeded for data cleaning, visualization, error estimate, 
  and plotting using python libraries such as sciPY, numpy, matplotlib, pandas and more. The process was automated via shell scripting.
  
2. File Name: Cleaning Procedure Analysis.pdf

  Project Name: Cleaning Procedure Analysis Through Hough Transform for All Sky Search for Continuous Waves
  Advisor: Dr. Pia Astone, INFN, “La Sapienza” University of Rome)
  Location: Rome, Italy
  
  I participated in my second REU by University of Florida's International REU (http://www.phys.ufl.edu/ireu/index.html) specializing in gravitational wave research.
  The project studied effectivness of the cleaning procedures on the VIRGO (https://www.virgo-gw.eu/) interferometer, designed to detect gravitational wave.
  Several data cleaning procedures were taken, including Short-time Fourier transform, peak mapping from heatmaps, and hough transform. The efficiency was also studied via 
  Mock Data Challenge (http://gallatin.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~keithr/lscdc/mockdata.html) where noise is artificially injected to a data before applying the cleaning procedures.
  The data cleaning, manipulation, visualization and calculations were done in MATLAB on a UNIX operating system.
  
 3. File Name: Visualization of the Higgs Interaction in the Standard.pdf
  
   Project Name: Visualization of the Higgs Interaction in the Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model Physics
   Advisor: Michael McGuigan, Department of Computational Science, Brookhaven National Laboratory
   Location: Upton, New York
   Publication: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7747823
   
   For the third project I worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory via Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships (SULI) by the U.S. Department of Energy. 
   The project aimed to create model based on the theoretically and experimentally verified Higgs interaction equations based on Particle Standard Model and 
   Beyond Standard Model Physics. Solved math equations and created dataframe, charts, graphs, 3D modeling, and animaitons for high energy physics model.
